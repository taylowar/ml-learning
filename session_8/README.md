# Expanding Neural Framework with a trainer/visualizator and generators 

* NNF stands for neural network factory
* Let's introduce a nnf which is an application for training and visualizing your neural networks 
* The application will produce a binary file file that can be then loaded with nf.h and used in your other applications

## Adder.gen
* A program dedicated to genrating training data and saving it in a binary file
